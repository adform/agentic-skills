  Delivery health root-cause check for RTB line items on Adform FLOW DSP. Runs structured
  checks on schedule, pricing, budget, banner assignment, creative audits, and advertiser
  vertical sensitivity, rolling up to Ok, Warning, or Critical. When pricing is flagged,
  supplements with mcpStats bid-reason breakdown to identify exact no-bid patterns. Trigger
  on "why isn't my line item delivering", "delivery health", "anything blocking this from
  serving", "no impressions from this line item". For slow pacing use adform-pacing-check;
  for dimensional performance stats use adform-stats-performance. Read-only.

# Adform delivery health

Why is this RTB line item not serving? Runs Adform's structured health checks — schedule,
pricing, budget, banner assignment, creative audit, advertiser vertical — and rolls them up to
Ok, Warning, or Critical. Read-only.

## Connection & tooling

Runs on the Adform GraphQL MCP. Use `graphql_execute` to run queries. Use `graphql_search` or
`graphql_introspect` to explore nested indication types. Keep calls sequential (~1–2s apart).

The `id` parameter requires the RTB setup ID (returned as `id` from `rtbLineItems(orderIds:)`).
This is distinct from the placement ID visible in some platform URLs.

## Data Availability

This skill covers real-time delivery indicators for active line items and campaigns only.

## Delivery health query

```graphql
{
  rtbLineItemDeliveryHealth(id: "99999") {
    status
    updatedAt
    indications {
      schedule { status }
      pricing { status }
      budget { status }
      bannerAssigned { status }
      tagCreativeAudit { status }
      advertiserIndustryVertical { status }
    }
  }
}
```

Each indication returns `Ok`, `Warning`, or `Critical`. Use `graphql_introspect` on the
specific indication type to retrieve additional detail fields such as `reason`.

---

## Supplementary: bid reason breakdown via mcpStats

When the `pricing` check returns `Warning` or `Critical`, use `mcpStats` with
the `bidReason` dimension to see the specific no-bid reasons causing lost
auctions. This gives the trader exact signal on whether the loss is price-based,
targeting-based, creative-audit-based, or budget-based.

Validated query:

```graphql
{
  mcpStats {
    totalRowCount
    totals
    columns {
      dimensions { bidReason { name } }
      metrics {
        rtbBids
        lostBids
        bidReasonCount
        impressions
        rtbWinRate
      }
    }
    rows(
      filter: {
        date: { from: "2026-06-01", to: "2026-06-30" }
        advertiser: { ids: ["2133936"] }
      }
      paging: { offset: 0, limit: 50 }
      sort: [{ column: 0, direction: desc }]
    )
  }
}
```

Scope the `advertiser` filter (or add `lineItem: { ids: [...] }`) to narrow to
the specific entity under investigation. The `bidReason.name` column will return
the platform's reason label for each no-bid category (e.g. price floor, creative
audit, targeting mismatch). Add this table to the delivery health summary when
pricing or budget is flagged.

## Reading the checks

- `bannerAssigned` — no eligible creative assigned to the line item; cannot serve until a
  creative is attached
- `tagCreativeAudit` — creatives not yet approved for the targeted inventory sources
- `pricing` — the primary bid cap is too low to win auctions, or the pricing model is
  misconfigured. Read the line item's buying type to identify which cap is relevant (e.g.
  Max eCPC for CPC buying, Max CPM for dynamic CPM) before recommending a specific increase.
  See the pricing model table in adform-line-items. Size a fix with adform-bid-landscape
- `budget` — budget exhausted or a budget configuration issue
- `schedule` — flight has ended, not yet started, or has a gap covering the current time
- `advertiserIndustryVertical` — sensitive-vertical restriction blocking certain inventory

---

## Presenting

Lead with the rolled-up status, then the specific failing check and a concrete recommended
action for the trader to apply — for example "assign an approved creative", "raise the
relevant bid cap (Max eCPC / Max CPM / etc.) to approximately X", or "the flight ended on
DATE — extend the end date". Always name the correct cap for the line item's buying type.
This skill never changes anything.

If the line item is serving but pacing slowly rather than blocked entirely, use
adform-pacing-check instead.
